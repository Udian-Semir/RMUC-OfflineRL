"""Action-space specification shared by every learner.

Two families are supported.

``continuous`` — the legacy 4-D layout ``(vx, vy, yaw_rate, fire)`` produced by
the ``velocity`` / ``goal`` dataset builds.  A single diagonal Gaussian covers
it.  Kept so old runs and checkpoints still load.

``tactical`` — the redesigned layout that matches how a real RoboMaster
autonomy stack is actually wired.  The decision layer does **not** drive the
gimbal or the trigger: auto-aim owns both loops at 100+ Hz, so a 1 Hz turret
*rate* is an aliased non-quantity and a 1 Hz *fire rate* is an outcome, not a
decision.  What the tactical layer genuinely decides is where to go, whom to
engage, and whether weapons are free::

    nav    (2, continuous)   sub-goal displacement in metres, scaled to [-1, 1]
    fire   (1, Bernoulli)    weapons-free gate for this second
    target (7, Categorical)  which enemy to prioritise; class 6 = "no target"

The target label is a **soft** distribution rather than a one-hot class.  The
referee log never records who was being shot at, so we recover it from the
muzzle bearing — and when several enemies sit inside the muzzle cone (55% of
firing seconds, measured) the assignment is genuinely ambiguous.  A soft label
represents that ambiguity honestly instead of guessing.

Discrete heads are also the direct fix for the failure mode that capped the
continuous policies: a Categorical is natively multi-modal, whereas an MSE /
single-Gaussian head regresses to the mean of a multi-modal target and emits
blurred, over-conservative actions.
