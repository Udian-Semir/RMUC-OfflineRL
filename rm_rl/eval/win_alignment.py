"""Does the policy behave more like the teams that WON?

Fitted-Q evaluation cannot answer "is this policy better than the logged one".
Its Q function is fitted on the logged state-action distribution, so any policy
that acts *differently* is scored off-support and penalised by the twin-Q min —
regardless of whether the difference is an improvement.  Deviation is exactly
what we are trying to produce, so FQE marks us down for succeeding.

This is a different, weaker, but *unbiased-in-the-right-direction* question.
Every episode carries a win/loss label.  For each logged state we ask what the
policy would have done and score how well that matches what actually happened,
then compare that agreement on **winning** episodes against **losing** ones:

    lift = agreement(won) - agreement(lost)

If the policy's proposals line up with winners more than with losers, it has
learned something that co-varies with winning.  A policy that merely copies the
average behaviour scores ~0 lift; a policy that mimics losing habits scores
negative.  Nothing here rewards or punishes deviation per se, so a policy is
free to differ from the log without being penalised for it.

Read it as evidence, not proof: this is a correlational test on observational
data, so it cannot establish that the policy *causes* wins.  A closed loop is
still the only way to settle that.
